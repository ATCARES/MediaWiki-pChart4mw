MediaWiki-pChart4mw
===================
This PHP Chart for MediaWiki extension (pchart4mw) allows you to visualize your data with charts like line-, bar-, pie-, radar-, scatter- and bubble charts. It uses the (free) PHP Chart library pChart to produce the charts. It allows for 2- or 3-dimensional charts, which are all within the potential of the pChart library. The charts are based on your data from the wiki page.

pchart4mw works, together with the pChart library, fully within your MediaWiki Server environment. The data is processed completely within the server environment. To enable full flexibility and full integration with other extensions pchart4mw supports both the standard MediaWiki tag syntax and the parser function syntax.
